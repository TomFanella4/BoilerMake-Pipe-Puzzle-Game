Description:
Pipe puzzle game for Android based off Bioshock. This app was developed during the Boilermake hackathon. 
The game uses GUI buttons and text to create a game where the user must find a path from the beginning to the end.
The board is randomly generated each time the game is played. After the game starts, the user may tap the pipes
to move them and then tap finish to check if the user's path is correct.

To be implemented:
- Title screen with easy, medium and hard settings
- Results screen with path attempted, time taken and win or loss text
- Picture representations pipes

Please Note:
- Game still contains a few bugs
- Increased optimization is needed
